PCAGO-Electron
================

Runs [PCAGO](https://github.com/rnajena/pcago-unified) as standalone desktop application
using the [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) framework.

## Download

You can find prepackaged versions of PCAGO-Electron [here](https://github.com/rnajena/pcago-unified/releases).

Following versions are available:

* Minimal: Only contains Electron.
* Standard: Contains Electron and ffmpeg
* Ubuntu: Contains Electron, ffmpeg and compiled dependencies for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (with R 3.4.3)

If a version does *not* contain compiled dependencies, PCAGO-Electron will automatically compile
the dependencies on first start. Please check if all required packages are installed.
Compilation will take a couple of minutes. The compiled dependencies can be re-used on other computers with the
same operating system.

## Requirements

* libgconf2 (Debian/Ubuntu: libgconf2-4)
* Dependencies that are required by [PCAGO](https://github.com/rnajena/pcago-unified/blob/master/src/README.md)

## Running

We provide prepacked versions of PCAGO-Electron that you can download [here](https://github.com/rnajena/pcago-unified/releases).
Download the appropriate version and run the included starter or just `electron.exe` (Windows)
/ `./electron` (Linux).

## Obtaining the source code

PCAGO-Electron requires PCAGO that has to be placed into the `pcago` folder.
If you are cloning the repository, you can run:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/rnajena/pcago-unified.git
```

## Running from source

To run PCAGO-Electron from source, you need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
Run `npm start` in the PCAGO-Electron folder to run the application.
If you use Linux, you should install `ffmpeg` (with MP4 support) from your
distribution's package sources. Otherwise you need to download a build of `ffmpeg` for
Linux and place it into the `ffmpeg-linux-x64` directory (see README file within this folder).

## Deploying PCAGO-Electron

To create prepacked versions of PCAGO-Electron, run `./deploy.sh`. This requires distributable versions of
Electron (electron-* directories), ffmpeg (ffmpeg-*) and R (R-*). See the respective README files for
more information.
