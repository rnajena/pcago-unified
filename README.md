# PCAGO
 
PCAGO is an interactive web service that allows analysis of RNA-Seq read
count data with principal component analysis (PCA) and agglomerative
clustering. The tool also includes features like read count
normalization, filtering read counts by gene annotation and various
visualization options.

# Running PCAGO

You can use our server on https://pcago.bioinf.uni-jena.de or run
PCAGO on your Linux computer via a server or as standalone application.

If you want to run PCAGO in RStudio or plain R, you find instructions
[here](https://github.com/hoelzer-lab/pcago-unified/blob/master/src/README.md).

## Run via Docker

Big thanks go out to Lasse Faber!

### Local machine
```
docker run -p 8000:8000 --user $(id -u):$(id -g) --rm -it mhoelzer/pcago:1.0--c1e506c ./run_packrat.sh
```

### Server
Run the docker container in the same way like above and additionally connect to the server with port forwarding.
```
ssh -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8000 your@your.server.com
```

In both cases you will then be able to access the PCAGO-Server via the following address in your browser: 127.0.0.1:8000.

# Installation

We offer an installation script designed for Ubuntu 18.04 that builds the
final server and standalone application including installation of dependency
packages.

1. Clone or [download](https://github.com/rumangerst/pcago-unified/archive/master.zip) our PCAGO repository
2. If needed, extract the \*.zip file
3. Open a terminal in the downloaded PCAGO folder
4. Run `./install.sh` and follow the instructions

When the installation is finished, you can navigate to the installation directory and
either start `pcago-electron.sh` to run the standalone application or run `./pcago-server.sh`
in a terminal to start the server.
