# About

PCAGO is a tool to analyze RNA-Seq results with principal component analysis.
You can use it to ...

* check if samples with the same treatment/condition cluster together
* find out how including less and less variant genes affect this clustering
* find sets of genes that explain most of the data

PCAGO provides additional features that lets you do your tasks easier, like ...

* filtering genes by *biotype*, *GO terms* and *scaffold*
* animating the clustering live when less and less variant genes are included
* importing annotations directly from online databases like Ensembl BioMart


## Quick usage

1. Go to the `Analyze` page
2. Upload your read counts in `Sidebar > Data > Import read counts` or choose example data
3. Upload the sample annotation `Sidebar > Data > Import samples annotation` or choose example data
